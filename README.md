## 📊 Project Overview

We used the **Customer Shopping Trends Dataset**, which simulates retail transactions with detailed customer demographics, purchase amounts, item categories, payment methods, subscription status, shipping preferences, and more.

The final Tableau dashboard was designed to:
- Be interactive and user-friendly
- Support data-driven decision-making
- Allow drill-downs by customer segments, regions, seasons, and product categories

## 🧩 What the Dashboard Shows

### 🔹 Key Questions Answered:
- What are the top-performing product categories by season and state?
- How does customer behavior vary across age groups, genders, and regions?
- What are the most used payment and shipping methods?
- Where are the most loyal customers concentrated?
- How do subscriptions and discounts impact purchase behavior?

### 🔹 Dashboard Features:
- **Choropleth maps** showing state-wise trends
- **Bar, stacked bar, grouped bar, and donut charts**
- **Filters** for season, product category, region, shipping type, etc.
- **Pre-attentive attributes** like color, length, and spatial position for clarity
